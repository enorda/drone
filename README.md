# 2024-25 UTD Raytheon UAX Drone Competition: Scout Drone

<p>The following README has instructions to setup, run, and simulate the code within this repository with the jetson</p>

<p>This repository is meant to be loaded onto the Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano related with autonomous drone flight, simulation, and visual processing.</p>

<p>

To gain full understanding of the code/repository **PLEASE FOLLOW 
THE STEPS IN ORDER**

Please read the documentation fully and thoroughly (your questions will probably be answered later in the documentation). Good Luck and feel free to reach out to past CS team on discord. :smiley:

This repository needs a lot of testing and optimization. As of 1/24/25 the HOMING changes from the bringMainUpToDate branch have not been tested on the actual drone and should be tested on sim to understand behavior first, and should be fixed if need be, once confident add the update the live drone behavior in the flyInSearchPattern function in DroneProcess.py under the else block for the live drone. 

Known Issues:
- Homing is untested (has only been tested on sim with a camera).
- Recording OpenCV window is slow but best we can do for right now recording.Full screen is even slower. Functionality is uncommited saved on jetson and updates are not in GitHub so be sure to find it and save the file if you want to keep the functionality before overwriting it when pulling in new changes.
- Starting and stopping all processes are unsynchronized so will need to fix that and make sure the processes are spun up in order so that the drone doesn't start flying before all the other processes are running. We also need a graceful exit.
- OpenCV functionality is not able to track fast enough likely due to motion blur, fps, resolution, or some combination. 
- Code is pretty ugly, we tried our best :frowning_face:

<h2> SITL Simulation</h2>

<p>

**NOTE:** dronekit-sitl is outdated and no longer supported along with dronekit, however it is a simple and easy to use interface and if necessary you can interact using pyMavlink commands exposed by the dronkit/dronekit-sitl interface

</p>

<p>

This can be used to simulate both the drone and ground vehicle through arducopter, it is suggested that if you are changing any flight procedures by adding, removing or editing dronekit/Mavlink commmands that we are sending to the cube pilot that you test thoroughly using SITL</p>

<h3>SITL Local Setup:</h3>

1. from drone local repository use command in terminal: 

        pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Install [Mission Planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-installation.html) 

3. Navigate to DroneCode folder and try to run ```TestSim.py```

> - If you see the following issue: 

```
PS C:\Users\rushi\OneDrive\Desktop\School\CS4485\drone\DroneCode> python TestSim.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\rushi\OneDrive\Desktop\School\CS4485\drone\DroneCode\TestSim.py", line 4, in <module>
    from dronekit import connect, Vehicle, VehicleMode, LocationGlobalRelative
  File "C:\Users\rushi\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Lib\site-packages\dronekit\__init__.py", line 2689, in <module>
    class Parameters(collections.MutableMapping, HasObservers):
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: module 'collections' has no attribute 'MutableMapping'
```

> - Change ```collections.MutableMapping``` to ```collections.abc.MutableMapping```
> - For further information regarding fix: https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python/issues/1132

5. Once you are able to run TestSim.py successfully, you should see an output similar to the following where you should see "The drone is not in guided mode yet" repeating after some time.

```
PS C:\Users\rushi\OneDrive\Desktop\School\CS4485\drone\DroneCode> python TestSim.py

6. You have successfully completed setup


<h3>Running Simulation:</h3>

1. Open Mission Planner & have TestSim.py running

2. Click Connect on Top Right Corner on Mission Planner (set connection type to tcp and make sure baudrate (number to the right of it) is set to 115200)

3. Set Hostname to 127.0.0.1 and Port to default port 5763 and connect

4. In Mission Planner once the parameters are loaded you should see an actions on the left hand side under the attitude indicator, under the actions tab you should see a  Set Mode in the first column of buttons. In the drop down selection to the left of the set mode button, change the mode to guided click the set mode button

5. You should now see the drone start flying in the football field doing the 30x30yd square search pattern

6. If you want to set waypoints that are not the calculation based 30x30 yd continue reading (This is likely how we will set it on competition day)

<h3> SITL continued:</h3>

7. If simulation is still running terminate the TestSim.py program and restart it. 

8. Connect Mission Planner to sim as before and go to the Plan tab on the top left navigation panel

10. Click the Read button on the right hand side

11. Set waypoints 1-4 from the program in a clockwise manner where 1 is top left corner of box

12. Set waypoint 5 for landing zone can be anywhere.

13. Click Save File if you want for future use

14. Click Write and you should see it populate the waypoints in the data tab 

> **NOTE:** if this fails just click read and clear the points and load the file or place points again and write. 

15. Change mode to guided and it should work according to the set waypoints

<h2> Camera Simulation</h2>

<p>

**NOTE:** To run ```cameratest.py``` you do not need Zed SDK as it should use the default camera on your system

</p>

1. To use the Zed Camera you will need the Zed SDK (this is already on the jetson, however if you want to run and test with that specific camera on a personal computer you will need this)

2. Use a 6x6 ArUco marker to test

3. Once cameratest.py is running we can now calibrate camera for pose estimation

4. Navigate to /drone/CameraCalibration directory

5. Take 10 photos at least using the camera you intend on using of the [chess aruco board on paper](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/doc/pattern.png). Upload them into the CameraCalibration/CalibrationImages directory.

> **NOTE:**  Make sure to take the photos at same resolution/frame size (eg. 1280,720) as what is going to be used when processing the images. The discrepency will cause issues for pose estimation later on with estimating axis distances. (You can probably implement some logic to easily do this using cv2.resize() if you can only take photos at 1 frame size or edit the resolution of the pictures manually)

6. Measure the square length, in my case I measured 2.5cm or .025m.

7. Go to calibration.py and change the variable ```square_size``` to what you have measured

8. Run calibration.py, it should generate calibration_chessboard.yaml. Once generated as long as the calibration parameters are accurate you don't need to change them for that specific camera that you have taken/uploaded the images with.

9. Now you can run pose_estimator.py to see how the camera position compared to static aruco is generated.

<h2>Running Real Drone</h2>

<p>When running code on live drone be sure to take necessary precautions, have a FAA licenced drone pilot at all times, even when operating autonomously. Be sure to test thouroughly before using on the real drone.</p>

1. Power drone and connect both Mission Planner and Remote to drone

2. Setup a mission on mission planner, create an inclusion zone aka "GeoFence" on mission planner along with the 5 waypoints setup same as step 7 under **SITL continued**.

3. VNC/SSH into Jetson

4. Run The following command in DroneCode Directory

        python IntegratedUAVcode.py --livedrone
